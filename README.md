# Dockerfile notes
The DockerFile downloads any necessary packages and libraries 
to build and link the zfp library to the main.cpp program. 
The vimrc commands in the dockerfile are not necessary to build and run this 
program and can be removed if needed.

# How to run 
Once you run the docker container in interactive mode, 
you can use the following command to build and run the main.cpp program
"./build_script.sh"

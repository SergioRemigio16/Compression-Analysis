    docker build . --tag CONTAINER
    docker run -it CONTAINER
    docker image ls
    docker pull CONTAINER
        Your container should start in interactive mode, and you should see a Linux prompt.
        Type 'exit' to leave Linux / stop your container.
    docker container prune
        This removes stopped containers -- it's an important step to remember.
